    <h4><p><i>Hey guys, thank you for visiting my website where you will learn about me. I am a nice person and I enjoy football and swim. I cant play basketball very well but I'll still grind it. I live in Belgrade, Maine where I can be found ice fishing or ripping the sled. Belgrade is well known for its lakes and beautiful views. Maine weather is the best weather even if the snow is taller then my dog most years. My family is mostly French Canadian and from Maine. I have one brother who is the complete opposite of me and my Mom (Amy) and dad (Fred). I work at Hannaford in Augusta ME and I used to work at the Hammond Lumber in Belgrade. Currently I attend college at the University of Maine in Orono. In the photo below is my roommate and I at a chilly festival with our girlfriends </p>
