    <h4><p><i>I love sports which Includes, football, swim, basketball, and baseball. Throughout highschool I only played two sports. In football I was always playing a new position. From running back my freshman year to quarter back and line backer, then lastly i finished senior year as a tight end and defensive end. As far as swim I hold four school records and was team captin my senior year.  </p>
